This program takes a user's input, make sure that it's a number, and then lets the user know if their number is odd or even.

Peer review by Carlos Felipe: This program is nutty. I'm seeing animations in the terminal?! what is this Wizard craft?! Amazing project, all inputs are accounted for using data validation and I can play this amazing project as many times as I want. 
10/10 would definitely play again once or twice.
